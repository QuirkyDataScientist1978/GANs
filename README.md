GANs Types Codes 
In This project you would find the codes for the following types:
1- Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs).
2- Least Square Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs).
3- Coupled Generative Adversarial Networks (CoGANs).
4- Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs).
5- Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs).
6- Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGANs). 

You would need to download the following datasets:

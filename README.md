# GANs <br/>
GANs Types Codes <br/>
In This project you would find the codes for the following types:<br/>
1- Deep Convolution Generative Adversarial Networks (DCGANs).<br/>
2- Least Square Generative Adversarial Networks (LSGANs).<br/>
3- Coupled Generative Adversarial Networks (CoGANs).<br/>
4- Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks (CGANs).<br/>
5- Super Resolution Generative Adversarial Networks (SRGANs).<br/>
6- Cycle Generative Adversarial Networks (CycleGANs). <br/>
<br/>
You would need to download the following datasets: <br/>
1- Celeba <br/>
2- MNIST <br/>
